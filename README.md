# Vaccine-Management-System

The aim of the project is to build a fully functional Information Management System for the purpose of vaccine management. It is implemented in C++ and uses various features of Object Oriented Programming and file handling.

The system provides different interface to the **admin** and the **user**. On the admin's panel, the management can handle the system records. On the user's panel, a user can register and get information about the vaccination centers and accordingly book his time slots for vaccine doses. To access the admin's panel, admin's credentials are required.
